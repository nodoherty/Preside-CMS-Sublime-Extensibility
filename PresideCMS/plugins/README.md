# Plugins
Sublime Text can be extended through Python plugins. Plugins build features by reusing existing commands or creating new ones. Plugins are a logical entity, rather than a physical one.

## Pre-requisites
In order to write plugins, you must be able to program in [Python](http://www.python.org/). At the time of this writing, Sublime Text used Python 3.

For more detail about creating plugins, please refer to the [plugins documentation](http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/extensibility/plugins.html) and the examples here in this repo.
