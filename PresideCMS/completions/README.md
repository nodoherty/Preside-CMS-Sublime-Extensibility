# Completions
In the spirit of IDEs, Sublime Text suggests completions that aggregate code or content while writing by catching everything that you have written, like variable names.

There are however several ways to extend the list of completions (for example, depending on the current syntax).

For more detail about defining completions, please refer to the [completions documentation](http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/extensibility/completions.html) and the examples here in this repo.
