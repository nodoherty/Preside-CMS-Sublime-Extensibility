# Commands
Commands are ubiquitous in Sublime Text: key bindings, menu items and macros all work through the command system. They are found in other places too.

For more detail about defining commands, please refer to the [commands documentation](http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/extensibility/commands.html) and the examples here in this repo.
