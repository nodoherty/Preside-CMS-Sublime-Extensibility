# Syntax Definitions
Syntax definitions make Sublime Text aware of programming and markup languages. Most noticeably, they work together with colors to provide syntax highlighting.
Syntax definitions define scopes that divide the text in a buffer into named regions.
Several editing features in Sublime Text make extensive use of this fine-grained contextual information.

For more detail about creating syntax definitions, please refer to the [syntax definitions documentation](http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/extensibility/syntaxdefs.html) and the examples here in this repo.
