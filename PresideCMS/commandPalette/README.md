# Command Palette
The command palette is an interactive list whose purpose is to execute commands. The command palette is fed entries by means of `.sublime-commands` files. Commands that donâ€™t warrant creating a key binding of their own are usually good candidates for inclusion in a `.sublime-commands` file.

For more detail about defining command palette items, please refer to the [command palette documentation](http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/extensibility/command_palette.html) and the examples here in this repo.

See also: [Reference for Command Palette](http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/reference/command_palette.html) which contains complete documentation on the command palette options.
