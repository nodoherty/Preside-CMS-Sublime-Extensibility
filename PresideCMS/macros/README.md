# Macros
Macros are a basic automation facility comprising sequences of commands. Use them whenever you need to repeat the exact same steps to perform an operation.

Macro files are JSON files with the extension `.sublime-macro`. Sublime Text ships with a few macros providing core functionality, such as line and word deletion. You can find these under *Tools | Macros* or in `Packages/Default`.

For more detail about defining macros, please refer to the [macros documentation](http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/extensibility/macros.html) and the examples here in this repo.
