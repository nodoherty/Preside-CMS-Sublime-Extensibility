# Snippets
Use snippets to save yourself tedious typing. Snippets are smart templates that will insert text for you and adapt it to their context.

To create a new snippet, select *Tools | Developer | New Snippet...* Sublime Text will present you with a skeleton for it.

For more detail about defining snippets, please refer to the [snippets documentation](http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/extensibility/snippets.html) and the examples here in this repo.
